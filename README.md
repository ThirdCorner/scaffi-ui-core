Docs to come.

IF you add new things, remember to run git add before pushing because even if you add to src, when you compile, the new
files in lib don't get automatically added to git.

If you add any files besides js (json, images, scss, etc) you have to manually copy them over to the lib folder.

Remember to run 'npm run compile' to push releases
